# YOLOv8-PostProcessing-PRCurve

This repository contains code for post-processing techniques and PR curve visualization for object detection using YOLOv8. The project aims to improve object detection results through advanced post-processing methods and provides an analysis of precision and recall using PR curves.

The YOLOv8 model used in this project is sourced from the [Ultralytics repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/yihong1120/YOLOv8-PostProcessing-PRCurve.git
cd YOLOv8-PostProcessing-PRCurve
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Label Conversion
The **'yolo_label_converter.py'** file provides functions to convert YOLOv8 coordinates to regular bounding box coordinates. It reads text files containing bounding box information and converts them to a pickle file for further processing.

To use the label converter, modify the **'folder_path'** variable in the **'main()'** function to point to the directory containing the label files. Then run the script:

```shell
python yolo_label_converter.py
```

The converted labels will be saved as **'y_true.pkl'**.

## Inference and Post-processing
The **'yolo_inference_and_postprocessing.py'** file extends the YOLOv8 **'detect/val.py'** script. It performs object detection on images using a trained YOLOv8 model and applies post-processing techniques such as OCR and aspect ratio correction.

To use the inference and post-processing script, make sure to update the **'model'** and **'source'** variables in the **'predict()'** function with the appropriate paths. Then run the script:

```shell
python yolo_inference_and_postprocessing.py
```

The predicted results will be saved as **'y_preds.pkl'**.

## PR Curve Validation
The **'pr_curve_validation.py'** file calculates precision and recall values from the predicted and ground truth bounding boxes and plots PR curves for each class.

To validate the predicted results, make sure to have **'y_preds.pkl'** and **'y_true.pkl'** files in the repository. Then run the script:

```shell
python pr_curve_validation.py
```

The PR curves will be displayed in the console.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs for post-processing and PR curve analysis in object detection using YOLOv8.

## Post-Process Flowchart
A flowchart illustrating the post-processing steps in **'yolo_inference_and_postprocessing.py'** can be found ![here](https://github.com/yihong1120/YOLOv8-PostProcessing-PRCurve/blob/main/images/yolov8_postprocess.png).

The flowchart above illustrates the post-processing steps performed in the yolo_inference_and_postprocessing.py script. It shows the sequence of operations, including OCR, aspect ratio correction, and other specific post-processing tasks.

## PR Curve Visualization
A visualization of the PR curves generated by **'pr_curve_validation.py'** can be found ![here](https://github.com/yihong1120/YOLOv8-PostProcessing-PRCurve/blob/main/images/PR-curves.png).
